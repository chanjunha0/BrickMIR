# BrickMIR: 
## A Minimal, Imbalance-tuned, and Ratio-based Framework for Brick Metadata Classification

This repository contains the solution for BrickMIR, developed for the Brick by Brick 2024 challenge focused on automating building timeseries data classification.

We propose a multi-label time-series classification framework for building metadata labeling. Rather than relying on absolute values (which vary widely across different buildings), we focus on ratio- and correlation-based features that capture each sensorâ€™s relative behavior. Along with minimal data cleaning and label-tuned class weights, this approach generalizes well across buildings with differing baselines, as demonstrated on the Brick by Brick 2024.

## Pipeline Order

1. **Download Raw Data**  
   Download all the raw train and test files from the competition website and place them in the root folder.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Run `data_cleaning.py` locally to clean and process raw training and test files.

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   Execute `process_train_test.py` locally to perform feature engineering on the cleaned datasets.

4. **Scale Factor Tuning**  
   Perform the scale factor tuning in the `scale_factor_tuning.ipynb`.  
   *(Note: This step is done, and the tuned parameters are in the model training script.)*

5. **Model Training & Prediction**  
   Use `model_train_predict.ipynb` on Colab for training the model and generating predictions.

6. **Post Processing (Optional)**  
   Run the scripts in the `post_processing` folder to enforce the Brick class hierarchy on the predictions.  
   *(Note: This step is optional and is not part of the final submission.)*
